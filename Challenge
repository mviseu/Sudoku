The sudoku challenge:
---------------------
Sudoku grid:
0 represents empty cell
1-9 are valid values

Success:
Each value (from 1 to 9) must be represented exactly once
 - in each row
 - in each column
 - in each 3x3 submatrix

Goals:
------
- User starts program (./sudoku)
- User selects cell (and gets visual feedback)
- User is prompted for value
- If move is invalid, user failed and should be appropriately shamed
- If user successfully solves the puzzle, happy game over

Usage requirements:
-------------------
- Program must be dumb proof (I will use it)
- At any given point, input required from user (if any) must be obvious

Technological requirements:
---------------------------
- Use cmake for building program

Bonus points:
-------------
- Pretty unicode characters
- Good looking README.md file
- Documentation option (i.e: sudoku -h, sudoku --help)
- Randomized starting grid that is always solvable

Hint:
-----
- Here is a way to clear the screen that's not too dangerous:
    ```std::cout << "\E[H\E[2J";"```
